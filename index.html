                <p>
                  Using the free version of Claude to build a trip planning
                  Website.
                </p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                  I asked Claude to come up with suggestions for several days
                  and to add a map showing the selected activites. I did this
                  over and over with different prompts and instructions until I
                  got a result I was happy with.
                </p>

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                  Several different results based on different prompts. I
                  learned that i had to be specific in my instructions to get
                  what i wanted.

                <p>
                  Use Claude in a better way than the previous project to create
                  my personal CV website. Claude in the browser is tedious and
                  error prone. In the previous project i had to start over many
                  times.
                </p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                  Learned about Claude Code! Claude Code is a terminal-based,
                  AI-powered agentic coding tool that helps developers analyze,
                  plan, write, and edit code. It integrates with your IDE and is
                  installed with a node package and runs in your terminal. I use
                  Visual studio code with a Claude extension and commit my work
                  to my GitHub repository. Then i asked Claude to read my cv pdf
                  file exported from LinkedIn and create my cv website with the
                  design based on another website.
                </p>

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                  Claude made an my CV webpage, perfectly reflecting the details
                  in my CV pdf file. It made the design based on the website i
                  referenced. I had to ask it to fix some bugs and make some
                  changes, but overall it was a great experience and I learned a
                  lot about how to use Claude Code.

                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p>
                  I wanted to see if Claude could help me create a simple game.
                  I told Claude only to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No
                  frameworks or libraries
                </p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                  With very short simple prompts Claude quickly made a initial
                  version of the game. Easily added the feature of a flaming
                  ball and speedup after playing 30 seconds
                </p>

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                  A simple functional Pong game, working on both computer and
                  phone

                  Use Claude to make a game more advanced than flaming pong
                </p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>
                  I asked Claude to create a platform game and it quickly made 
                  a crude platform game with 5 platforms and a player that could jump and move left and right.
                  The player was a square and the platforms were rectangles.
                  I commited the initial code and began expanding the game with more features                                                  
                </p>

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                  A platform game editor full of features like adding platforms, props, and enemies.
                  It is mindblowing that so much can be acheived in a short period of time.
                  The game is still a work in progress, its the most advanced project i have done with Claude

                <h3>Claude Pro subscription is not enough if you use it a lot!</h3>
                <p>
                  When you use Claude code, you have a certain amount of tokens you can use per 5 hours.
                  I you use your tokens up, you have to wait until they refresh. This is very frustrating when you are in the middle of a project.
                  I also found out that only have access to the Sonnet 4 model (for everyday use) and not the more advanced 
                  Opus 4 modul (for complex tasks). I had to upgrade to a max plan to get access to Opus 4.
                  The Pro subscription is €15 per month, the Max subscription is €90 per month.

                <h3>Claude is a great pair programming partner, but he needs you!</h3>
                <p>
                  It is great that Claude can make a lot of the code for you, but you have to be there to guide him.
                  You save all the time you would have spend researching and writing boilerplate code.
                  I learned a lot about how to debug together with Claude, if you know how to debug and give him clues
                  he can solve complex problems quickly. Asking him to solve a problem again and again will make him try
                  different solutions until the problem is solved, but sometimes he gets stuck in a loop and you have to help him out.

                  I learned that it is important to have a good structure in your code from the beginning.
                  Ask Claude to create a folder structure and organise your code in a logical way.
                  This will make it easier to find things later and will make your code more maintainable.
                  I also learned that it is important to have a good naming convention for your files and variables.
                  This will make it easier to understand what the code does later.

                  I had tried to describe the bug to Claude, but he could not solve it. 
                  When I sent him a screenshot of the bug, he quickly found the problem and fixed it.
